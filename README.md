# Datadog Monitoring Project - Xavier Green

To improve:
 - event managed between front and back (socket?) to add new web, pause, stop, run..
 - class to manage a 'service' that hold one url
 - test through all methods, by using a sandboxed environment (sandi for ex) and stubs on external methods, chai assert
 - dynamic frontend update (if web, smthg like reactjs - especially if reload time < refresh request time)
